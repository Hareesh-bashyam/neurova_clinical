# Limitations and Known Risks

## Self-Report Bias
Responses are self-reported and may be influenced by literacy,
social desirability, or misunderstanding.

## Cultural Context
Scores may be influenced by cultural and language factors.

## Non-Diagnostic Nature
High scores indicate symptom burden, not a clinical determination.

## Risk Mitigation
- Clear disclaimers
- Mandatory clinician review for red-flag cases
- Training requirements for deployment sites
