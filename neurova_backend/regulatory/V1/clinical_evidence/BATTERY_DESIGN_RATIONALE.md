# Battery Design Rationale

## Purpose
To justify the combination of screening instruments within predefined batteries.

## Example: Complete Mental Health Assessment (CMHA_V1)

### Included Instruments
- PHQ-9: Depression screening
- GAD-7: Anxiety screening
- MDQ: Bipolar screening
- PSS-10: Stress assessment
- AUDIT: Alcohol use screening
- STOP-BANG: Sleep-related risk assessment

## Rationale
Mental health presentations commonly involve comorbid conditions.
Using a bundled battery reduces patient burden and enables holistic screening.

## Limitation
Battery results do not replace clinical interviews or clinical evaluation.
