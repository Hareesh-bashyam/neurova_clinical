# Configuration Scope Declaration

## Fixed (Non-Configurable)
- Test questions
- Test order
- Scoring thresholds
- Severity band definitions

## Configurable
- Disclaimer text
- Crisis helpline numbers
- Branding and report header
- Organization display name

Clinical integrity and validation require that scoring logic
and instruments remain fixed per approved version.
